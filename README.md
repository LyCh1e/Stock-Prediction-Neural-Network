# Stock Price Prediction Neural Network

A modular neural network system that fetches stock data from **Yahoo Finance** (no API key required) and predicts OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) prices with scenario analysis, accuracy scoring, and full model persistence. Comes with a complete Tkinter GUI for managing multiple stocks simultaneously.

## Features

- **Multi-Output Neural Network**: Predicts all price points (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) simultaneously
- **Advanced Scenario Analysis**: Generates Best Case, Average Case, and Worst Case forecasts
- **Yahoo Finance Integration**: Free, no API key needed — data fetched via `yfinance`
- **Adaptive Learning**: Continues learning from new data on each update cycle
- **Technical Indicators**: RSI, MACD, SMA (20/50), Bollinger Bands, Volume Ratio, Volatility, Momentum
- **Market Sentiment Analysis**: Bullish/bearish scoring across multiple indicator signals
- **Model Persistence (JSON + CSV)**: Network weights, scaler params, and prediction history saved to `stock_models.json` / `stock_models_history.csv` after every train, predict, and update — model resumes from where it left off on next startup
- **Accuracy Scoring**: Composite 0–100 score with letter grades (A+ → F) measuring price error, directional accuracy, and within-range hits
- **Complete GUI**: Two-tab interface — Stock Manager and per-symbol Charts
- **Market Status Indicator**: Live color-coded label showing Pre-Market, Open, After-Hours, or Closed (US Eastern time)
- **Interactive Charts**: Actual price history with future forecast band (best/worst/avg); zoom / pan / save toolbar
- **Background Auto-Updates**: Adaptive model updates round-robin across all tracked symbols; predictions refreshed every 5 minutes — the UI never freezes
- **Live Current Price**: Current Price column reflects the latest traded price (intraday during market hours, official close after market close) — not a stale end-of-previous-day value
- **Excel Export**: OHLCV history → `stock_data.xlsx`, prediction scenarios + daily scores → `stock_predictions.xlsx`

```

Required packages: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `yfinance`, `openpyxl`, `requests`

## System Architecture

The project follows SOLID principles with a clean dependency-inversion layer. All high-level modules depend on abstract interfaces (`core/interfaces.py`), and concrete implementations are wired together in `ui/app.py`.

### Package Layout

```
core/
  interfaces.py     — Abstract base classes (IDataFetcher, IModelRepository, IHistoryRepository, ISymbolRepository)
  models.py         — Shared data models (ScoreResult, PredictionRecord)

data/
  fetcher.py        — YahooFinanceFetcher (implements IDataFetcher)
  indicators.py     — Technical indicator calculations

ml/
  network.py        — NeuralNetwork (forward/backward, Monte Carlo uncertainty)
  trainer.py        — ModelTrainer (epoch loop, warm-up + step-decay LR schedule)
  predictor.py      — StockPredictor (scenario generation)

scoring/
  scorer.py         — score_symbol() — composite 0–100 accuracy score function

services/
  trading_service.py — StockTradingService (data + ML orchestration)
  stock_registry.py  — StockRegistry (in-memory store + background thread workers)

storage/
  model_repository.py   — JsonModelRepository (network weights → stock_models.json)
  history_repository.py — CsvHistoryRepository (prediction log → stock_models_history.csv)
  symbol_repository.py  — JsonSymbolRepository (tracked symbols → tracked_symbols.json)
  excel_exporter.py     — ExcelExporter (OHLCV + prediction xlsx files)

ui/
  app.py        — StockPriceApp (root window, tab composition, message-queue bridge)
  stock_tab.py  — StockManagerTab (symbol table, buttons, activity log)
  chart_tab.py  — ChartsTab (per-symbol interactive price + forecast charts)

launch.py       — Dependency checker and entry point
```

### Neural Network (`ml/network.py`)

`NeuralNetwork` — custom two-layer network (ReLU hidden, linear output):

```
Input Layer  (lookback_window × 12 features)
      ↓
Hidden Layer (30 neurons, ReLU + Monte Carlo noise at inference)
      ↓
Output Layer (5 outputs: Open, High, Low, Close, Volume)
```

Training uses He initialisation, MSE loss, and an adaptive learning rate that halves when gradient variance is high.

**12 features per time step:**
1. Open
2. High
3. Low
4. Close
5. Volume
6. SMA-20
7. RSI (14-period)
8. Volume Ratio (vs 20-day average)
9. Volatility (20-day std)
10. MACD
11. MACD Signal
12. Price Momentum (10-day)

### Accuracy Scoring (`scoring/scorer.py`)

Composite score (0–100) from three components:

| Component | Weight | What it measures |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| MAPE accuracy | 50% | How close the predicted close was |
| Directional accuracy | 30% | Did the model get up/down right? |
| Within-range accuracy | 20% | Did the actual close land inside the best/worst band? |

Letter grades: A+ (≥93) → F (<20). Scores update automatically after every prediction cycle.

### Service & Registry (`services/`)

- `StockTradingService` — orchestrates data fetching, feature engineering, training, prediction, and adaptive updates
- `StockRegistry` — manages all tracked stocks, runs training / prediction / update jobs in background threads, delegates to injected repositories

### Model Persistence Flow

```
_train_thread
    → JsonModelRepository.restore_weights  (if saved weights exist → resume & short retrain)
    → ModelTrainer.train                   (full epochs if new; ~20% epochs if resuming)
    → JsonModelRepository.save            (weights + scaler → stock_models.json)
    → CsvHistoryRepository.save           (pred_history → stock_models_history.csv)

_predict_thread / _update_thread
    → predict / adaptive_update
    → archive_prediction    (push current pred into history)
    → save model + history
```

### Excel File Layout

| File | Contents |
|------|---------|
| `stock_data.xlsx` | One sheet per symbol — append-only OHLCV history |
| `stock_predictions.xlsx` | One sheet per symbol — scenario rows (Best/Average/Worst) + daily score rows (predicted vs actual close, in-range signal) |

### Persistence File Layout

| File | Contents |
|------|---------|
| `stock_models.json` | Network weights and scaler params per symbol |
| `stock_models_history.csv` | Prediction log (Symbol, Date, Avg, Best, Worst) — capped at 5 most recent entries per symbol |
| `tracked_symbols.json` | Tracked symbols with lookback and epoch settings |

### Market Status Indicator

The status bar shows the current US market session based on Eastern time:

| Status | Hours (ET) | Colour |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Pre-Market | 4:00 AM – 9:30 AM | Orange |
| Market Open | 9:30 AM – 4:00 PM | Green |
| After-Hours | 4:00 PM – 8:00 PM | Blue |
| Closed / Weekend | All other times | Grey |

Updates every 60 seconds automatically.

## Usage

### GUI Workflow

```
1. python launch.py
2. Enter a stock symbol (e.g. AAPL) and click "Add & Train"
3. Watch training progress in the Log
4. Switch to the Charts tab to see the price history and forecast
5. Click "Predict All" to refresh forecasts
6. Click "Update All" for adaptive incremental learning
7. Click "Update Stock Data" or "Update Predictions" to write xlsx files
```

### GUI Button Reference

| Refresh Charts | Redraw all chart tabs with latest data (Charts tab) |

### Scenario Generation

Three scenarios are derived from the base prediction by applying volatility multipliers shaped by:
- Current RSI and MACD readings
- Market sentiment score
- Recent price volatility
- Model confidence

3. **Bollinger Bands** — 20-day, ±2 std
4. **MACD** — (12, 26, 9)
5. **Volume Indicators** — SMA, ratio vs average
6. **Volatility** — 20-day standard deviation
7. **Price Momentum** — 10-day
8. **Support & Resistance** levels
9. **Trend Analysis** — short and long term

## Troubleshooting

**Missing packages:**
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib yfinance openpyxl requests
```

**"No data available" for a symbol:**
- Verify the ticker is valid on Yahoo Finance (e.g. `AAPL`, `MSFT`, `SPY`)
- Check your internet connection
- `yfinance` may be temporarily rate-limited; wait a moment and retry

**GUI not launching:**
```bash
python --version   # requires Python 3.9+
python launch.py   # checks dependencies before opening the GUI
```

**Weights not loading on startup:**
- `stock_models.json` is created after the first successful training run
- If the saved `input_size` doesn't match the current feature count (e.g. after a feature set change), the model logs a warning and retrains from scratch

**"Update Stock Data" fails:**
- If `stock_data.xlsx` is corrupt or empty, it will be automatically recreated from the current in-memory data

## Disclaimer

**IMPORTANT**: This is an educational project for demonstration purposes only.

- **Not Financial Advice**: Predictions are based on historical patterns and must not be used for actual trading decisions
- **Market Risk**: Stock markets are volatile and past performance is not indicative of future results
- **Model Limitations**: Neural networks have inherent uncertainty — treat outputs as one signal among many

Always consult a qualified financial professional before making investment decisions.
